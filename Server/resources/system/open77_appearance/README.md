# Open77 persistent appearance

This auto-start resource opens Cyberpunk 2077's native in-game character customization mirror,
captures the resulting logical customization options, validates them on the server, and persists
them per authenticated Open77 GUID and server-owned character key.

## Commands

- `/appearance [ripperdoc|hairdresser] [male|female]`
- `/appearance male` or `/appearance female` (full-editor shorthand)
- `/barber`
- `/wardrobe` opens the optional `open77_wardrobe_ui` fitting room (also F7).

## Client exports

```lua
exports.open77_appearance:open("ripperdoc", "female")
local snapshot = exports.open77_appearance:capture()
local revision = exports.open77_appearance:revision()
```

## Server integration

The active RP character defaults to `default`. A server-side gamemode can switch it after its own
authorization and character selection logic:

```lua
TriggerEvent("open77:appearance:setCharacter", playerId, characterGuid)
```

After a successful optimistic-concurrency commit the resource emits:

```lua
AddEventHandler("open77:appearance:saved", function(playerId, userGuid, characterKey, revision, snapshot)
end)
```

The database bridge must be enabled in `server/server.jsonc`. The table is created automatically;
`sql/001_appearance.sql` is also provided for managed migrations. All statements are parameterized,
and appearance edits use one-shot nonces plus revision checks.

Equipment and wardrobe persistence lives in `open77_character_presentation`, created automatically
or through `sql/002_presentation.sql`. Its key is the authenticated user and active RP character.
The menu sends only edited equipment slots, replaced outfit sets and renamed outfits in one
revision-checked transaction. All seven outfits and their names share the same JSON row; legacy
rows without names or revision remain readable. A rejected or failed save retains the previous
committed state. Preview changes are local until Save succeeds.

## It holds the join-time readiness gate

This resource is a **participant** in the platform readiness gate
(`Open77.ready`, see [docs/lua-resources.md](../../docs/lua-resources.md#the-join-time-readiness-gate)).
Every player who connects arrives with one hold in its name, so no other resource may teleport,
spawn or kill them until this one has answered.

- **A returning player** — a saved character is found, the hold is released the moment the lookup
  returns, and nothing waits. This is the overwhelmingly common path and it must stay that way.
- **A new player** — the hold is kept, with reason `character_creation`, while they build a
  character, and heartbeat-refreshed every ten seconds for as long as the creation is genuinely in
  flight. It is released on commit, and within ten seconds of an abort, a rejection or an expiry.
- **Database disabled** — resolves an explicit development default; changes do not persist.
- **Configured database unavailable, corrupt data, or a failed lookup** — reports bootstrap
  failure rather than silently substituting a default character. The shell must complete its
  pristine-world bootstrap before gameplay placement is allowed.

Why it exists: on 2026-08-27 the database was enabled on the live Pursuit server for the ranked
ladder. The database bridge is per-server, not per-resource, so persistence came on here too and
this resource began opening the character creator on join — while the gamemode, told by the same
client announcement, teleported those players to its lobby. The gate is what makes the two
compatible without either resource knowing the other exists.
