-- `apply` becomes a new *record*, which is the server's word about what this
-- player wears, and the ordinary `reconcile()` above puts it on the body. That
-- is the same road `open77:appearance:restore` takes at world entry, so a
-- relayed face survives a death, a bucket change and a reload exactly like a
-- stored one, instead of being quietly undone by the next reconcile.
--
-- What it does NOT do is change the body family. A different family is a player
-- *reload*, not an appearance change, and a caller that asked to restore a face
-- has not asked for that; a snapshot whose gender disagrees with the body on the
-- player is refused by name instead.
