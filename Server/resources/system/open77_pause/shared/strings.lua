-- THE string table for the pause menu.
--
-- Every player-facing word this resource owns lives here and nowhere else --
-- not in index.html, not inline in its JavaScript, not in a Lua print that
-- reaches the screen. The page paints its static labels from `data-t` and asks
-- for the rest through `PauseText.t` / `PauseText.fmt`; the client script reads
-- the same table directly, because `shared_script` runs it in the same Lua
-- state as `client/main.lua` (ResourceHost.cpp:868 prepends shared scripts to
-- the client list, so this file is loaded first).
--
-- `{name}` is a placeholder, substituted by `fmt` on either side.
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, because it is data rather than language:
--
--   * every engine setting's label and every option name in a dropdown. They
--     come from the engine, already localised, on the `meta:` line the script
--     bridge now emits (Open77SettingLabel / Open77SettingOption in
--     client/redscript/Open77ScriptBridge.reds). Before that line existed the
--     page carried a hand-written English table of twenty names and camel-case
--     split the rest, which is exactly the hardcoding this file forbids;
--   * audio device names, which Windows supplies;
--   * key names and the human name a resource gave its own key mapping;
--   * server names, player names, endpoints and versions.
--
-- A missing key renders as its own dotted path. That is ugly ON PURPOSE: a
-- blank label hides the mistake, a visible `settings.filterPlaceholder` does
-- not, and the second one gets fixed.
