# open-voice

`open-voice` is a compact, pma-voice-inspired reach-mode companion for the
native OPEN//77 voice stack. It depends on `open77_voice`, which remains the
only owner of microphone capture, PTT/VAD, Opus, routing, playback and network
media. This package never reads PCM/Opus and never calls `setTransmitting`.

## Defaults

The server owns and validates every mode in `server/config.lua`:

| Mode | Distance |
|---|---:|
| `whisper` | 3 m |
| `normal` | 20 m |
| `shout` | 40 m |

F11 cycles the modes by sending `open-voice:cycle` to the authenticated server.
The server rate-limits the request, chooses the next mode from its own current
state, and applies it through `Open77.voice.setProximity`. The client never sends
or applies an arbitrary distance. Names, labels, colors, distances, default mode,
key and cooldown are checked at server resource load; invalid configuration
fails the resource rather than silently weakening policy.

Supported cycle keys are A-Z, 0-9, F1-F12, SPACE, ENTER/RETURN and the arrow
keys. Input is ignored while another WebUI captures the keyboard.

## HUD states

The 60 fps HUD is one compact line in the bottom-right corner with no panel or
background: a mic glyph tinted by state, a twelve-segment input meter, the
active range with its distance in the range's colour, the cycle key, and a
pulsing "heard" counter that only appears while someone is audible. States:
`idle` (grey), `detected` (cyan), `talking` (mint, glowing mic), `muted` (red,
slashed mic, meter dark), `offline` (dark grey, slashed). A server rejection
shows as a red line above it for a few seconds. `setHudVisible(false)` hides
the whole line.

## Client integration

Other client packages can call `getState()`, `getModes()`, `requestCycle()` and
`setHudVisible(visible)` through `Open77.exports.call("open-voice", ...)`.
`open-voice:modeChanged(mode, distance, label, color)` is emitted locally after
each canonical server response. `open-voice:cycle` and
`open-voice:setHudVisible` are equivalent local events. None of these APIs can
submit an arbitrary distance; reach remains server-owned.

Trusted server packages can emit
`open-voice:setPlayerMode(playerId, modeName)` or
`open-voice:cyclePlayerMode(playerId)`. After a canonical application,
`open-voice:modeApplied(playerId, modeName, distance, label, color)` is emitted
locally on the server. These are local events, not registered network events.
