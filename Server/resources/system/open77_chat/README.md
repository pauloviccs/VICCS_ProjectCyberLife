# open77_chat

`open77_chat` is Open77's server-distributed chat resource. It provides an animated WebUI chat
overlay, authenticated messages, slash-command dispatch, completion, and a small client API for
other resources. Its HUD follows the CyberM/Open77 Design System: the passive feed stays compact in
the top-left corner, while opening chat unfolds the full channel panel and command index. The surface
requests the runtime's maximum 240 fps cadence for uncapped-feeling input and transitions; an idle
page is damage-driven and does not repaint continuously.

## Controls

- `T` opens chat.
- `Enter` submits the current input.
- `Escape` closes chat without sending.
- Arrow keys select a suggestion.
- `Tab` completes the selected suggestion.

The open panel also shows message length, connection state, and a new-message control if the player
has scrolled away from the latest entry. Closing it folds the controls away; recent messages remain
in the passive feed and fade after their configured duration. The passive feed is shorter than the
open list and is always pinned to the newest row; `scripts/tests/chat-scroll-browser.cjs` checks
that contract headlessly (open, send, Esc, mixed-height error rows) at three window geometries.

## Messages and commands

Normal text is sent through `chat:submit` and broadcast by the authoritative server resource. Input
beginning with `/` is tokenized and routed through `open77:command:execute`; it is never broadcast as
a chat message.

```text
/weather.set rain 20
/loot.create.player 1 Items.money 250
/mycommand "one argument" plain\ value
```

The parser supports single quotes, double quotes, escaped spaces, and at most 32 tokens. Restricted
commands require the matching `command.<name>` ACL permission.

`/id` replies privately with the caller's temporary network player ID. This ID changes across
sessions and must not be used as a persistent account identifier.

## Suggestions

Server resources can publish command suggestions after receiving `chat:ready`:

```lua
local suggestions = {
    {
        command = "/garage.open",
        help = "Open a configured garage.",
        parameters = {
            { name = "garageId", help = "Configured garage identifier." },
            { name = "force", optional = true }
        }
    }
}

RegisterNetEvent("chat:ready", function()
    TriggerClientEvent("chat:addSuggestions", source, suggestions)
end)
```

Client resources may also emit `chat:addSuggestion`, `chat:addSuggestions`, and
`chat:removeSuggestion`.

## Client API

```lua
TriggerEvent("chat:addMessage", {
    type = "system",
    author = "GARAGE",
    text = "Your vehicle is ready.",
    color = { 0, 229, 255 }
})

AddEventHandler("chat:commandSubmitted", function(raw, tokens)
    print(raw, tokens[1])
end)
```

Messages accept the following presentation fields in addition to `author`, `text`, `playerId`,
`color`, and `segments`:

| Field | Values | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `type` or `kind` | `player`, `system`, `announcement`, `warning`, `error`, `action`, `join`, `leave` | Selects the visual message grammar. `player` is the default chat row. |
| `channel` | `global`, `local`, `squad`, `whisper`, `ooc`, `admin` | Adds channel presentation metadata. Routing remains the sending resource's responsibility. |
| `role` | `admin`, `mod`, or a custom label | Adds a compact role marker beside an author. |
| `mention` | boolean | Highlights a message intended for the local player. |
| `title` | string | Overrides the heading of an announcement. |
| `time` | string | Overrides the client-generated `HH:MM` timestamp. |
| `duration` | milliseconds | Controls how long the passive row remains before fading. |

All fields are optional, and the pre-0.4 message shape remains valid.

Exports:

- `addMessage(message)`
- `clear()`
- `addSuggestion(command, help, parameters?)`
- `removeSuggestion(command)`
- `setEnabled(enabled)`
- `isEnabled()`

## Security

- Source IDs are supplied by the authenticated server session.
- Slash commands cannot bypass the server ACL.
- Messages are sanitized and limited to 256 UTF-8 bytes.
- WebUI content is rendered as text, never injected as HTML.
- Local client events cannot invoke protected server commands.
