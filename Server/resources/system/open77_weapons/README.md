# open77_weapons

Official asynchronous facade for the local player's three standard weapon
slots. Templates are exact TweakDB record names such as
`Items.Preset_Lexington_Default`.

```lua
CreateThread(function()
    local promise, reason = Open77.exports.call(
        "open77_weapons", "assign",
        "Items.Preset_Lexington_Default", 1, { active = true })
    assert(promise, reason)
    local requestId, callError = promise:await()
    assert(requestId, callError)
end)
```

Client resources may also use the lower-level native method
`Open77.weapons.assign(...)` directly when they declare the weapon permission.

Listen for `open77:weapons:completed` to learn whether REDengine accepted and
verified the change. Server resources use `Open77.weapons.*`; see
`docs/weapon-api.md` for the full contract.

Exact spare and loaded rounds are asynchronous too:

```lua
Open77.weapons.setAmmo(1, {
    reserve = 120,
    magazine = 18,
    activate = true,
})
```

## ACL-gated admin commands

```text
/weapon.give <playerId|me> <template> [slot=1] [active=true]
/weapon.remove <playerId|me> <slot>
/weapon.ammo <playerId|me> <slot> <reserve> [magazine]
```

Both commands are registered as restricted server commands. Grant
`command.weapon.give`, `command.weapon.remove`, and/or `command.weapon.ammo` to
an ACL principal (the built-in `admin` role already holds `command.*`).
`weapon.ammo` reports only after the client verifies reserve, magazine,
capacity, and total. `weapon.remove` clears the slot but deliberately keeps the
item in the player's inventory.

## Explosions on every screen (blast relay)

Only the client that simulates a car can move it, and only the client whose
engine ran an explosion applies its physics. `server/blasts.lua` turns an
explosion the server can vouch for into one `open77_weapons:blast` per physics
owner of every other car in reach, and tells every player close enough to hold
a copy of an NPC in reach to knock its own copy down (`client/blasts.lua` calls
`Open77.weapons.applyBlast`). It needs a client DLL with that native; an older
client ignores the relay.

| Source | Accepted when |
|---|---|
| Grenade (`onPlayerExplosion`) | the thrower consumed a frag, incendiary or cutting grenade (`onGadgetConsumed`) — one detonation per grenade, near where it was thrown, in its bucket, at grenade cadence |
| Car explosion | the car's canonical `exploded` flag rises; its simulator's own world is not repeated |
| Mounted weapon (`onVehicleWeaponExplosion`) | the vehicle weapon ticket admitted the projectile's explosion |
| `exports.open77_weapons:relayBlast` | another server resource (the `rp_weapons_effect` lab) admitted it; bounded like the rest |

Radius and impulse come from server tables, never from a client; nothing here
deals damage. Players are launched only when the gamemode asks for it:

```lua
-- Server, once per start of the gamemode and of open77_weapons.
Open77.exports.call("open77_weapons", "setBlastPolicy", {
    players = true,                                   -- knock nearby players down
    safeZones = { { x = 0, y = 0, z = 0, radius = 30 } },
    buckets = { 0 },                                  -- optional: street only
})
```

The policy lapses when the resource that set it stops. `open77_blasts off`
(server convar) disables every source; `/weapon.blasts` (ACL
`command.weapon.blasts`) prints counters and refusals, and
`exports.open77_weapons:blastStats()` returns them.
