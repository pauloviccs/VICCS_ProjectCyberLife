-- Kabuki Arena -- containment authority and the server-side leash BACKSTOP.
--
-- Bounds accept legacy boxes and the Freeroam arena's XY cylinder. The shared
-- predicates/projection keep client enforcement and server checks identical.
--
-- The cylinder had to go because Kabuki is a gallery six metres above a sunken
-- floor: a cylinder either clips the bridge off or swallows the street outside.
-- A polygon prism was rejected for a different reason -- it needs an ordered
-- ring and a winding test and buys nothing at this scale, while a box test is
-- six comparisons and is what a surveyor can actually capture.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHERE THE GEOMETRY LIVES, AND WHY NOT HERE.
--
-- `shared/kabuki.lua` owns the map: the seven volume boxes, the marks, and
-- every geometric predicate. It is GENERATED -- `/dm.survey dump` rewrites it
-- wholesale from coordinates captured in-game -- so nothing in this file may
-- hold a coordinate that a surveyor's paste would have to keep in step.
--
-- This file owns the RULE and calls kabuki's predicates: `Kabuki.locateIn`,
-- `Kabuki.nearestIn`, `Kabuki.distanceTo`. It deliberately implements no
-- containment test of its own. Two containment tests that can disagree is a bug
-- waiting for a Friday, and it would present as "the diagnostic says I am
-- inside and the server keeps placing me".
--
-- The zone -- which volumes a format plays in -- is a RULE and comes from
-- `Config.zones[<format>]`, by name. The names are the seam between the two
-- files.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- THIS FILE IS NOT THE WALL.
--
-- Decision 15, settled by measurement on 2026-08-31: the wall is the CLIENT-SIDE
-- CLAMP. E1 proved props are solid, and then E2 proved `visible = false` does
-- not hide one -- the ring was accepted (`created=8 refused=0`) and rendered
-- anyway. The requirement is an invisible wall, so no arrangement of props can
-- meet it. The client polls its own position, projects back inside on the
-- nearest surface plus an inset, and writes a sub-metre transform; props
-- survive only as an optional visible marker.
--
-- What lives HERE is the authority behind that clamp: a player held outside for
-- N consecutive samples is PLACED, because a clamp that can be disabled is not
-- authority. It is a backstop, not a mechanism, and the difference shows in the
-- timings -- five seconds, not a quarter of one.
--
-- And this file DECIDES; it never PLACES. Every placement in the mode is one
-- `kill -> respawn` primitive owned by main.lua, carrying the fade, the
-- streaming preload and the grace window; bounds calls the placer main.lua
-- registers through `setPlacer`. That separation is why a backstop cannot
-- invent a second way to move a player.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THE SAMPLING RULE, and it is the part most likely to be got wrong.
--
-- From the constraints ledger: never judge a player mid-transition; an
-- UNREADABLE position FREEZES accumulators rather than resetting them; and rules
-- are "held continuously for N seconds", sampled at ~5 Hz.
--
-- Two accumulators are kept, not one, and BOTH must be satisfied to act:
--
--   outsideSinceMs   wall-clock, when the player was first seen outside
--   outsideSamples   how many CONSECUTIVE readable samples said outside
--
-- An unreadable sample advances neither. That pairing is what makes the freeze
-- safe in both directions:
--
--   * time alone would convict a player across a replication gap -- the clock
--     keeps running while the server cannot see them;
--   * samples alone would let a player who lags into one sample per second sit
--     outside indefinitely;
--   * a RESET on unreadable would let anyone stay outside forever simply by
--     interrupting their own replication, which is precisely the exploit
--     pursuit's bounds file names in its own freeze comment.
--
-- Three answers, never two. `inside == nil` means the rule cannot tell and is
-- NOT a claim that the player is outside. Callers must not read it as one.
--
-- An UNSURVEYED or PARTLY surveyed zone is one of those cannot-tell answers,
-- and that is the single most important line in this file: an empty zone
-- contains nothing, so a naive read makes every player permanently outside and
-- the backstop places the entire instance every five seconds. `Kabuki.locateIn`
-- distinguishes `zone_empty`, `not_surveyed` and `outside_partial:n_of_m` from
-- a plain `outside` precisely so this file can freeze on the first three and
-- convict only on the last.

--- EXEMPTION. A surveyor cannot survey a map they are being ejected from.
---
--- Found the hard way on 2026-08-31: `/dm.goto` moved the surveyor 2500 m to
--- Kabuki, the placement succeeded, and the lobby leash pulled them straight
--- back to the lobby a few seconds later. Both halves were behaving correctly
--- -- the travel worked, and the leash correctly judged a player standing
--- 2500 m outside the lobby volume. The two are simply incompatible, and the
--- resolution is not to weaken the leash but to say who it does not apply to.
---
--- This is deliberately NOT a duration. `hold` carries a placement grace and
--- expires because a placement ends; a survey session has no natural length,
--- and a grace long enough to walk a district is indistinguishable from having
--- no leash at all for everybody who forgot to clear it. An explicit set that
--- someone must switch off is the honest shape: `/dm.survey clear` and
--- disconnect both clear it, and it is ACL-gated at the command.
--- The exemption has more than one OWNER, and that is why it is a set rather
--- than a flag.
---
--- Two things switch it on independently: opening a survey session, and the
--- operator saying `dm.leash off`. With a single boolean, whichever switched
--- OFF last won -- so clearing a survey session silently revoked a leash the
--- operator had set by hand, and the next step they took teleported them back
--- to the lobby. Measured the hard way on 2026-08-31, on the owner, twice.
