-- Kabuki Arena -- loadouts: issue, VERIFY, resupply.
--
-- M10 of server/instances.lua: `equipWeapon`, `stripWeapons`,
-- `normalizeWeaponId`, `weaponRequests` and the `open77:weapons:completed`
-- handler leave main.lua and land here. The main.lua edits that go with this
-- file are listed in the anchored block at the top of server/scoring.lua, with
-- everything else main.lua has to change; there is one list, not two.
--
-- Three slots now, where the shipped mode issued one and left the other two
-- empty (plan section 7):
--
--   FFA    slot 1 the rotating equalizer, slot 2 the fixed sidearm, slot 3 the
--          melee. All three from `Config.equalizer`. `Config.weapons` no longer
--          exists; the rotation is `Config.equalizer.rotation`.
--   Arena  the kit picked in the buy window, from `Config.kits`. Identical list
--          for both teams -- the choice is the player's, the catalogue is not.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- THE HANDSHAKE IS ASYNCHRONOUS AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT
-- ===========================================================================
-- `Open77.weapons.assign` does not equip a weapon. It returns a REQUEST ID and
-- the verdict arrives later, on `open77:weapons:completed`, carrying the
-- `tweakDbId` the client actually ended up holding. That verified id -- not the
-- record we asked for -- is what the damage arbiter matches a reported shot
-- against.
--
-- The consequence is the security property of the whole mode and it is worth
-- stating plainly: A PLAYER WHOSE WEAPON NEVER VERIFIED CANNOT LAND DAMAGE.
-- `instance.weaponIds[playerId]` stays nil, the arbiter's
-- `weapon_not_verified` branch refuses every shot, and bots.lua's
-- `verifiedWeaponId` hook -- which reads the same table -- refuses the
-- player -> bot path for the same reason. Failing to write that table is
-- therefore FAIL CLOSED, which is why nothing here ever guesses an id from the
-- record it requested.
--
-- Four things the shipped handshake got right and that are preserved verbatim:
--
--   1. THE 250 ms GAP between removing the old weapons and assigning the new
--      ones. The removals are themselves asynchronous; assigning into a slot
--      still being torn down loses the assignment silently.
--   2. THE VERSION PER PLAYER. Every issue and every strip bumps it, and a
--      completion whose version no longer matches is DROPPED. Without it a
--      verdict from the previous round -- an assign that took a second while
--      the round rolled over -- writes a stale TweakDBID into the current
--      round's arbiter table, and the player's real weapon stops registering.
--   3. THE NORMALISED "0x..." FORM. TweakDB ids are 64-bit hashes and a Lua
--      number holds 53 integer bits, so the canonical form is a lowercase hex
--      string with leading zeroes stripped. Comparing an unnormalised id
--      against a normalised one never matches, and the failure looks exactly
--      like a cheater.
--   4. THE REQUEST IS KEYED BY `tostring(requestId)`. Request ids cross as
--      strings; a numeric key and a string key are different table entries.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- MEASURED, AND LOAD-BEARING: RESERVE ONLY. NEVER A MAGAZINE.
-- ===========================================================================
-- `Open77.weapons.setAmmo` fails AS A WHOLE when `magazine` exceeds the
-- weapon's capacity. Measured 2026-08-31 and recorded in
-- docs/research/pvp-arena-and-bots.md: a Lexington given
-- `{ reserve = 300, magazine = 60 }` left the counter at `000 0000` -- not a
-- clamped magazine with a good reserve, NOTHING -- while the same call as
-- `{ reserve = 300 }` produced `000 0300` immediately.
--
-- The failure is silent and it looks like a weapon bug rather than an ammo
-- bug, so `ammoOptions` below is the ONE place ammunition options are built and
-- it drops a `magazine` key with a loud log rather than passing it through. Do
-- not add one back "just for the pistol"; capacity is per weapon and this file
-- does not know it.
--
-- Ammunition is also RESUPPLIED at round rollover and on respawn
-- (`Config.equalizer.resupplyOnRoundStart` / `resupplyOnRespawn`). The shipped
-- mode issued the reserve once, so a player who survived a long round simply
-- ran dry -- with no message, which reads as a broken gun.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- STATE
-- ===========================================================================
-- Several instances run at once, so the loadout book lives ON THE INSTANCE
-- (`instance.loadout`) and never in a module table. Two exceptions, both
-- deliberate:
--
--   * `versions[playerId]` -- a monotonic per-player counter. It has to outlive
--     instance membership, because the stale completion it exists to reject is
--     exactly the one that arrives after the player left the instance that
--     issued it. A player is in one instance at a time, so it cannot leak
--     across instances.
--   * `pending[requestId]` -- the in-flight request registry. A request id is
--     server-wide, and the completion handler is handed nothing but that id, so
--     the lookup cannot be per instance. Every entry CARRIES its instance id
--     and is checked against the player's current instance before it applies.

--
-- THE CHOOSABLE PRIMARIES, and why they are not the kits above.
--
-- The `/guns` picker used to offer `Config.kits.list` -- four kits, which is
-- the ARENA buy list and was borrowed because it was the only weapon list in
-- this file. It now offers `Config.loadout.primaries`: every canonical firearm
-- of the 2.31 build, 49 of them, each one a row of
-- docs/generated/weapons-2.31.csv. The filter that selects them is written out
-- above the list in shared/config.lua so anyone can re-run it.
--
-- `kitList`, `kitByKey`, `kitFor` and `chooseKit` are UNTOUCHED. server/arena.lua
-- publishes `kitList()` into its buy-window fragment and reads `kitFor` for the
-- issued kit; the four kits are that window's catalogue and were never this
-- picker's problem. The only place the two lists still meet is `resolvePrimary`
-- below, which accepts a kit key as an alias so `/guns sniper` keeps working.

--- The arsenal, or the equalizer rotation if a server has no arsenal
--- configured. The fallback is not decoration: the rotation is the other list
--- of primaries in this mode, so an operator who empties `primaries` gets a
--- ten-weapon picker rather than a dead command.
---
--- A MODULE function rather than a file-local because `Loadout.rotate` -- which
--- is declared far above this line -- has to ask whether an arsenal exists.
--- That is the same reason `rotate` already calls `Loadout.mode()`.

-- ============================================================ weapon choice --
--
-- `/guns` -- the free-for-all answer to "which gun do I get to play with".
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- THIS DOES NOT DELETE THE EQUALIZER, IT SWITCHES AGAINST IT
-- ===========================================================================
-- Decision 14 gives every player in a free-for-all instance the SAME weapon,
-- rotating each round, and it is the mode's clearest idea: fights stay readable
-- and nobody loses to a loadout. Per-player choice is in direct tension with
-- that, so the two are a SWITCH (`Config.loadout.mode`, with the `loadoutMode`
-- tunable in front of it) rather than a blend. Every line of the equalizer path
-- above and in round.lua is intact and is what `mode = "equalizer"` still runs,
-- rotation included. `choice` is the shipped default because it is what was
-- asked for; an operator flips it back live from the Warden panel.
--
-- The ARENA is not touched by this switch. Its formats declare
-- `loadout = "kit"` and it already has a buy window, so a mode flag that
-- silently rewrote them would be a second, invisible rule.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- TWO STORES, AND THEY ARE DIFFERENT FACTS
-- ===========================================================================
--   `instance.loadout.kits[playerId]`  the ARENA buy-window pick. Per instance,
--                                      because a buy window belongs to a match.
--   `choices[playerId]`                the SESSION pick. Module scope, because
--                                      it has to outlive a respawn, a round
--                                      rollover AND the instance itself -- a
--                                      player who leaves a full instance and
--                                      lands in a fresh one is the same player
--                                      with the same preference.
--
-- `/guns` writes both: it means one thing everywhere, and `chooseKit` refuses
-- anywhere that is not an arena buy window, so the second write costs a
-- refusal and nothing else.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- RECONNECT: DELIBERATELY NOT PERSISTED
-- ===========================================================================
-- `forget` drops the pick on disconnect, exactly as it drops `versions`. There
-- is no gamemode persistence layer yet (phase 8 is unstarted), so the
-- alternative is not "remember across sessions", it is "keep a table entry
-- keyed by a player id the platform is free to hand to somebody else". That is
-- not a missing feature, it is a bug that would silently arm a new arrival with
-- the last occupant's kit. The cost of the honest answer is one click: the
-- picker opens by itself on the reconnecting player's first round.
--
-- A HOT RELOAD loses the pick too, along with `versions`, the instance round
-- and everything else this VM holds. It does NOT re-prompt -- see
-- `maybePrompt` -- so a Lua save stays silent, which is the half that matters.
