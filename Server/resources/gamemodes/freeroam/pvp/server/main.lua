-- Kabuki Arena -- lifecycle, placement and the state push.
--
-- LAST in the manifest, and the smallest file the mode can have. Section 6's
-- table, applied: eight sibling modules landed around this one and took the
-- queue, the countdown, the weapons, the standings, the boundary rule and the
-- single global `match` with them. What is left here is what nothing else can
-- own:
--
--   * the LIFECYCLE -- connect, ready, the readiness gate, disconnect;
--   * the LAZY ROSTER -- there is still no way to list players, so `players`
--     is repopulated from the next event carrying an id, and a player already
--     standing in an instance bucket after a hot reload is ADOPTED rather than
--     dragged to the lobby (which would place, and therefore kill, a live
--     fighter);
--   * the ONE PLACEMENT PRIMITIVE -- `placeAt`, and the two shapes of it,
--     `placeInArena` and `sendToLobby`. Every placement in the mode is one
--     `kill -> respawn` and it happens exactly here. bounds.lua decides,
--     round.lua and arena.lua decide, this file places;
--   * the DAMAGE ARBITER -- `Open77.combat.onDamage` is host-global, so the
--     instance gate has to live where the callback does;
--   * the TICK, the STATE PUSH and the COMMANDS.
--
-- Everything else is a one-line call into `Deathmatch`. If a rule is being
-- decided in this file, it is in the wrong file.
--
-- Ids arrive as STRINGS at every lifecycle handler and every net event.
-- `Deathmatch.playerId` is applied at each entry point, once; a `tonumber` at
-- only some of them is how one player ends up with two records that never meet.
--
-- Every player-facing string comes from `Config.strings.notice` through
-- `Deathmatch.notice(playerId, kind, key, ...)`. No literals here.

-- `deathmatch:bounds` and `deathmatch:boundsClear`; `Deathmatch.bounds.payload`
-- builds the first. Without this push the boundary simply does not exist on
-- the client and only the five-second server backstop remains.
--
-- Sent on TRANSITION only -- the zone key is remembered on the record and the
-- payload goes out when it changes -- so the state push can call this at its
-- own rate without flooding a player with a box they already have.

-- ------------------------------------------------ did the placement TAKE? --
--
-- `placeAt` returns true when the RESPAWN REQUEST was accepted, and that is a
-- different fact from the body having arrived. The chain under it is
-- fire-and-forget on both sides. `PlayerLifeService.Respawn` only records the
-- request and broadcasts it; the client's `LifeReplication::ApplyLocal` queues
-- a `ResurrectEvent` (asynchronous -- the engine processes it later), calls the
-- teleport native ONCE with no navmesh readback, and then acknowledges with a
-- position it samples IN THE SAME FRAME, before either operation can have
-- settled. Neither side ever re-reads the settled transform, and the client's
-- `transitionAckRevision == state.revision` guard makes every server
-- retransmission of that revision a no-op -- so a placement that did not take
-- is never retried.
--
-- That is the mechanism behind the owner's report of players who "spawn on the
-- floor" and have to disconnect and reconnect: reconnecting is the only thing
-- that produces a fresh revision to apply. It is the PLAYER-side twin of the
-- bot failure fixed 2026-09-01 in NpcAuthorityService -- one requested spawn
-- point, one engine placement somewhere else, and nothing that reconciles the
-- two -- but it is a different subsystem and this fix does not reach it.
--
-- THIS DOES NOT CORRECT IT, and that restraint is the decision. A re-place is
-- a kill (see the note below), so a correction rule that fired wrongly would
-- kill live players on a production server; and the only way to know a body is
-- inert rather than merely elsewhere is to read the settled transform, which
-- only the client can do. What this does is make the failure VISIBLE and name
-- the mark, so a spawn mark the engine will not honour can be found in a log
-- instead of in a player's complaint. The bot side of the same question is now
-- answered by the server's `NPC spawn projection adopted` line.

-- ============================================================ state push --

-- R10. The record-shaped part is all this file owns; everything about the
-- fight comes from one call. THE FRAGMENT IS AUTHORITATIVE for `phase` and
-- `playerState` -- a player eliminated in an arena round and a player waiting
-- out a free-for-all respawn are different states main.lua has no way to tell
-- apart, and there is no stale copy here to fall back to.
--
-- --------------------------------------------------------- the HUD contract --
--
-- Measured 2026-08-31, in game: a player standing in a live Kabuki round --
-- armed, with ammo, inside the market -- was shown the LOBBY DOCK. Nothing was
-- broken in the round and nothing was broken in the HUD; the two spoke
-- different shapes. The fragment is FLAT (`instanceId`, `instancePlayers`,
-- `protectionMs`) and says nothing at all about whether the player is IN a
-- fight, while open77_deathmatch_hud gates its entire in-round layout -- the
-- band, the weapon card, the K/D block, and the HIDING of the lobby dock -- on
-- one boolean, `participant`, that nothing had ever sent. Absent, it reads as
-- false, and a HUD told it is not in a match draws a lobby forever.
--
-- The shaping therefore happens HERE and not in the HUD. The fragment stays the
-- server's own vocabulary and every module goes on writing it unchanged; this
-- block is the single place that translates it, and it only ever ADDS keys:
--
--   participant       in an instance at all -- the master gate
--   instance{}        id, label, format, players, bots, capacity
--   self{}            the local player's own standings row + the shield window
--   participantCount  combatants in the round, bots included
--   maxPlayers        the instance capacity, for the occupancy readout
--   matchId           instance-round, for the match eyebrow
--   queuedNext        arena queue only; free-for-all never queues (decision 2)
--   crosshair         the gamemode's say over the reticle
--   phase             normalised to the HUD vocabulary; `roundState` keeps the raw
--
-- `phase` is the one key rewritten rather than added, and only for the
-- free-for-all standings interval. round.lua calls that state `standings`; the
-- HUD -- and its CSS, in four selectors -- calls the end-of-round screen
-- `resolved`. Same moment, other name. The raw value survives as `roundState`,
-- so nothing is lost, and arena's `buy` / `between` pass straight through:
-- those are genuinely different states, and inventing an equivalence for them
-- would be a lie rather than a translation.
local HUD_PHASE = {
    standings = "resolved",

-- HOW MANY BOTS THIS INSTANCE HOLDS, and the history is worth keeping because
-- the same trap caught two files a fortnight apart. `defaultHost.addParticipant`
-- binds a bot TWICE -- under its negative participant id, and again under its
-- uint64 npc id as an alias, so the damage gate can resolve a shot arriving
-- under either -- and both bindings used to land in `instance.actors`. Anything
-- that counted that table read 2 for one bot and 12 for six: the HUD did, and
-- was fixed here; `/dm.instances` did, and was not, which is how a 3v3 filled
-- with five bots printed `1/6+10bot` on 2026-09-01 and cost an hour to a
-- hypothesis about bots accumulating across rounds that was never true.
--
-- The kernel now keeps the two spaces in two tables (`Instances.bindActor`), so
-- `actors` is the participant space and counting it is honest. Three sources are
-- tried in the order of their authority: bots.lua owns bot lifecycle and counts
-- its own; the kernel's `botCount` is the one definition of the table walk; and
-- a plain count of `actors` is the last resort for a host that has neither.

-- being handed noclip -- "bounds BACKSTOP player=1 zone=lobby held outside
-- 8.6s / 31 samples -> placed" -- and it would have caught the next person too.
--
-- So the capability gets its own name. The leash is still on by default and
-- still authoritative for players; this only says who it does not apply to, and
-- it is restricted, so saying it requires the ACL.
