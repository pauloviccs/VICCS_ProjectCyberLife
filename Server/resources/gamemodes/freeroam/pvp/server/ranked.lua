-- Kabuki Arena -- career stats. Plan section 10, Phase 8.
--
-- The S5 seam scoring.lua reserved:
--
--   + if Deathmatch.scoring.ladderEligible(instance) then ... write ... end
--
-- This file is the `... write ...`. It persists what scoring.lua ALREADY KNOWS
-- -- kills, deaths, assists, headshots, multi-kills, best streak, score, damage
-- -- rather than recomputing any of it from a damage log this mode does not
-- keep. A career that disagreed with the scoreboard the player just read would
-- be worse than no career at all.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- WHERE THE STATS LIVE, AND WHY THERE
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- 1. A PER-SERVER LADDER OWNED BY THE GAMEMODE, not a platform-wide profile
--    owned by the master.
--
--    The master (`Open77.Master`) owns accounts, licensing and leases, and it
--    is not reachable from server Lua at all -- there is no binding for it, so
--    a global profile would mean a new C# surface, a new master schema, and a
--    production deployment, for numbers that are only meaningful relative to
--    ONE server's tuning. A kill/death ratio earned under `killLimit = 30`,
--    the 49-weapon arsenal and a 12-player instance is not the same
--    measurement as one earned under an operator's own settings, and averaging
--    them would produce a number that describes nothing.
--
--    Decision 8 makes this cheap to be wrong about in one direction only:
--    progression gates NOTHING, so no other system has to read these rows. And
--    the key below is the master-backed GUID, so promoting this to a global
--    profile later is a migration of rows that are already keyed correctly --
--    not a re-keying. Starting global and discovering the numbers are not
--    comparable is the expensive mistake; starting local is not.
--
-- 2. MySQL THROUGH `Open77.database`, BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY DURABLE STORE
--    SERVER LUA HAS.
--
--    `LuaResourceRuntime.Sandbox` nils out `io`, `os`, `package`, `dofile`,
--    `loadfile`, `load` and `require`. A resource cannot open a file, cannot
--    write one, and cannot even load a chunk from a string. `server/.open77/`
--    is host-owned and written only by C# -- and two of the files in it
--    (`master-identity.json`, `resource-signing-key.json`) are registration
--    SECRETS rather than cache, so it is not somewhere a gamemode has any
--    business writing even if it could. `Open77.tunables.set` does reach disk,
--    but it is a form's worth of declared scalars, not a table.
--
--    So: the database bridge, exactly as `pursuit/server/ranked.lua`,
--    `open77_appearance` and `open77_playerstate` use it. The manifest already
--    declared `database.access` for this phase.
--
-- 3. NO DATABASE IS A SUPPORTED STATE, NOT A FAILURE.
--
--    `server.deathmatch-local.jsonc` ships with the bridge OFF on purpose, and
--    says why: turning it on makes the credential mandatory, and it also wakes
--    `open77_appearance`, which then demands character creation the autonomous
--    test loop cannot drive. So the career degrades to a LOUDLY LABELLED
--    in-memory table for the run, and every readout says which store answered.
--    A silent volatile ladder is indistinguishable from a broken one.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- THE THREE THINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BROKEN THIS
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- 1. DECISION 12 IS ENFORCED AT THE WRITE, AND IT IS THE FIRST THING THIS FILE
--    DOES. `recordRound` consults `Deathmatch.scoring.ladderEligible` before it
--    reads a single row. A bot round produces no snapshot, no queue entry, no
--    announcement and no statement -- there is nothing for a later query,
--    export or migration to remember to filter out, because nothing was
--    written. `ladderEligible` is two independent sticky taints AND-ed
--    (scoring.lua's own, and bots.lua's per-round one), and both fail closed.
--
-- 2. PLAYER IDS ARE REISSUED; THE IDENTIFIER IS NOT. Every row is keyed on
--    `Open77.players.identifier` -- the 36-character master-backed GUID bound
--    to the client's identity certificate. Keying on a player id would arm the
--    next arrival on that id with the last occupant's career.
--
--    That binding is one of the FIVE that RAISE from inside the C function on a
--    non-positive id, and the CLR exception unwinds past every `pcall` and
--    stops the resource -- the crash that killed every bot round four seconds
--    in. A bot is a participant with a NEGATIVE id and bots are in the
--    standings rows this file iterates. So the id is gated by `DM.playerId`
--    (which returns nil for anything below 1) BEFORE the binding is touched,
--    and never after.
--
--    It also returns `nil` for a player who has already gone, which is exactly
--    when a round resolves. Identity is therefore captured EAGERLY, on connect
--    and at round start, and the snapshot is what the write uses.
--
-- 3. NOTHING ACCUMULATES ACROSS ROUNDS IN LUA. The unit of persistence is ONE
--    ROUND. A hot reload hands the successor VM a fresh everything, so a module
--    that banked a session total and flushed it "later" would lose whatever it
--    was holding on every Lua save -- and this mode is edited while it runs.
--    Recording at round end means a reload can cost at most the round that is
--    live, which is unavoidable and honest; and the pending queue itself rides
--    across the reload in `Open77.state`, which is host-owned and survives the
--    VM (though deliberately not a resource stop, and not a server restart --
--    that is what the database is for).

-- Two tables, and the second is not bookkeeping either.
--
-- `<prefix>career` is the ladder: one row per identity PER MODE, because a
-- free-for-all K/D says nothing about a 1v1 (plan section 10) and folding them
-- together would produce a number that describes neither.
--
-- `<prefix>rounds` is one row per persisted round per player, and it exists so
-- that "a round containing a bot leaves no row behind" -- the Phase 8 gate,
-- verbatim -- is a question somebody can actually ASK:
--
--     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM open77_dm_rounds WHERE instance_id = ? AND round_id = ?;
--
-- An aggregate-only ladder can only ever be checked by not moving, which is
-- indistinguishable from a ladder that is not writing at all.
--
-- THERE IS NO NAME COLUMN, and that is deliberate rather than an omission --
-- `pursuit_ranked_ratings` carries one and this does not. A career row is
-- durable, exportable data on a real person; the identifier is opaque and
-- already master-backed, and the display name is answered live by
-- `Open77.players.name` at the moment somebody reads the card. Storing it would
-- put a chosen human-readable handle on disk for no capability at all.
