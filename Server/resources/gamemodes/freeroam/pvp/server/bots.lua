-- Open77 deathmatch -- bots.
--
-- THE BOTS FIGHT WITH CYBERPUNK'S OWN COMBAT AI. This file no longer picks
-- their targets, walks them, or subtracts anybody's health on a timer.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- WHY THE SCRIPTED COMBAT LAYER IS GONE
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- It was never fighting FOR the engine; it was fighting AGAINST it. Three
-- findings, in the order they landed:
--
--   F10  `aiMode` reaches no engine call at all. It rides the replica and is
--        exposed to Lua, and `NpcReplication.cpp`, `NpcTasks.cpp` and
--        `Puppets.cpp` branch on it NOWHERE. Server-side it gates task
--        scheduling and the authority lease and nothing else. So `tasks` and
--        `native` are the same thing on a client, and every Maelstrom bot this
--        mode has ever spawned has had full vanilla combat AI running.
--
--        SUPERSEDED IN PART, 2026-09-01. `aiMode` now reaches exactly one
--        engine call and it is the one this mode needs: `NpcReplication`'s
--        hostility sweep treats `native` as "this body is meant to fight the
--        other `native` bodies of its bucket", and makes that true explicitly
--        (`client/src/api/Hostility.hpp`). The rest of F10 stands -- nothing
--        switches vanilla combat AI on or off, and nothing can.
--
--   Observed in game, 2026-09-01, and it is the whole indictment: some bots hit
--        the player through walls while others "look normal". That is TWO
--        combat systems on ONE body -- the scripted timer, which has no
--        occlusion, no aim and no animation, and the engine's, which has all
--        three. The minimap read COMBAT, a vanilla enemy health bar was drawn
--        over a bot, and a bot closed to melee. None of that is ours.
--
--   And the scripted layer was actively sabotaging the engine's. `moveTo` was
--        re-issued every 500 ms with the movement channel CLEARED first, which
--        cancels whatever command the behaviour tree had running. A body told
--        twice a second to walk somewhere cannot take cover, cannot strafe, and
--        cannot hold a firing line.
--
-- So the fake is deleted. What replaces each piece:
--
--   TARGETING          the engine's. Attitude, senses, the target tracker.
--   LINE OF SIGHT      the engine's raycast. The old `hasLineOfSight` tested
--                      whether both endpoints sat inside the arena volume --
--                      and the market is ONE box, so every point was "visible"
--                      from every other. It has been DELETED, not fixed: a
--                      predicate that returns true everywhere is worse than no
--                      predicate, because it reads like a check.
--   MOVEMENT           the engine's. No task stream. See HANDS OFF below.
--   THE BOT'S GUN      the engine's. The bot draws, aims and fires a real
--                      weapon; the VICTIM's client observes the resulting
--                      `gameHitEvent` and reports it.
--   BOT VS BOT         the engine's, through faction rivalry -- which is why
--                      the template list is now three MUTUALLY HOSTILE gangs
--                      rather than one. Maelstrom against Maelstrom is one
--                      side, and one side does not fight.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- HANDS OFF: WHAT THIS FILE MUST NOT DO TO A COMBAT BOT
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- There is no "release control" call and none is needed -- the client's
-- authority tick issues a native command only while a movement task exists
-- (`NpcReplication.cpp`, `ActiveTask(... Movement)`), and cancels whatever was
-- running the moment there is none. So an EMPTY TASK QUEUE IS the hands-off
-- mode. The rule is therefore a rule about restraint:
--
--   * never enqueue a movement task on a combat bot;
--   * never enqueue a look task on a combat bot -- a forced `lookAt` fights the
--     aim controller for the same bone chain;
--   * never `setTransform` except as the leash of last resort, because a
--     teleport revokes the simulation lease and bumps the epoch.
--
-- `damagePolicy` is the one thing Open77 itself would impose: every policy
-- other than `mortal` installs a `gameGodModeSystem` Immortal source on the
-- projected body, which floors the vanilla damage pipeline. Bots are `mortal`
-- and must stay `mortal`.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- THE MULTIPLAYER PROBLEM, AND THE ONE RULE THAT SOLVES IT
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- Every client that streams a bot in spawns the same full `NPCPuppet` from the
-- same record and runs its own copy of the behaviour tree. Nothing suppresses
-- it: `Toggle(AIHumanComponent)`, disabling `Senses`, a queued
-- `AIHoldPositionCommand` and a friendly attitude group have all been measured
-- and all failed. There is one authority client per NPC and it owns TASKS, not
-- the AI.
--
-- So on my screen the bot is shooting me, and on yours it is shooting you. If
-- witnesses were allowed to report, one burst would be credited N times.
--
--   OWNER REPORTS. The client that owns the body reports the hit.
--
--     player -> bot   the SHOOTER's client. Exactly one client's player pulled
--                     that trigger, so there is no duplicate to suppress.
--     bot -> player   the VICTIM's client. Exactly one client owns that player,
--                     so there is no duplicate to suppress.
--
-- This is duplicate-free for any number of clients without suppressing
-- anything, and it needs no cross-client agreement about who is fighting whom.
-- What it does NOT buy is a single consistent fight: two clients may see the
-- same bot standing in different places. Health does not diverge, because the
-- server ledger is the only thing that writes a health number.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- TWO HEALTH LEDGERS, AND WHICH ONE WINS
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- The engine body carries the record's own priced pool -- 206 points for the
-- Maelstrom grunt, read off the vanilla health bar in game. This file says 100.
-- They are not in conflict, because `NpcReplication::ApplyState` projects the
-- server value as a FRACTION (`Api::Life::SetHealth(entity, health/maxHealth)`)
-- rather than as points.
--
--   THE SERVER LEDGER WINS, AND ITS 100 IS A PERCENTAGE SCALE.
--
-- A 26-point hit is 26% of whatever the record's pool happens to be, so four
-- hits kill a bot regardless of which gang it belongs to. That is why the three
-- templates need no rebalancing against each other, and why nothing here reads
-- the engine's number.
--
-- It also explains the "bots are unkillable" report exactly. Vanilla damage
-- lands on the engine pool, the server never hears about it, and the next
-- revision bump re-projects the canonical fraction -- so the bar drops and
-- snaps back. Reporting the hit is what closes that loop: the report decrements
-- the server ledger, and the fraction that comes back is the lower one.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- THE TWO REPORT PATHS
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- `CombatReplication` mirrors NpcReplication into `s_npcBodies` and emits two
-- client Lua events off the wrapped `ScriptedPuppet.OnHit`. The client half of
-- this resource forwards them; this file admits them:
--
--   deathmatch:npcHit     I shot bot <npcId>. Carries the engine's damage, the
--                         absolute world Z of the intercept, the weapon and the
--                         attack kind.
--   deathmatch:npcHurtMe  bot <npcId> hit me, for <amount>.
--
-- Neither is trusted for the number it carries. The player -> bot amount comes
-- from this file's round-weapon table so that a bot takes the same number of
-- shots as a player does; the bot -> player amount is the engine's, CLAMPED,
-- because that direction is what "the engine's combat, faithfully" means and an
-- unclamped gang record can two-shot somebody.
--
-- The body part is derived from `hitZ - canonicalBotZ`, never reported. There
-- is no "I hit the head" field, because a body part the client chooses is a
-- damage multiplier the client chooses.
--
-- Both paths reuse the gate battery built for the old ray report: identity,
-- verified weapon, cadence, duplicate `seq`, per-second token bucket and a
-- per-player damage-per-second ceiling.
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT VALIDATED, and it is a real change of posture: this
-- file no longer runs its own hit test. It cannot -- the server has volumes,
-- not geometry, and the whole point of the engine path is that the SHOOTER's
-- machine has the bones and the walls. Range and bucket are still checked, but
-- the wallhack-shaped hole the old ray report had is now closed by the engine
-- raycast rather than left open, and the client's say shrinks from "here is a
-- ray, pick somebody" to "the engine says I hit this specific body".
--
-- R5, DOUBLE COUNTING, is handled by construction rather than by discipline:
-- `combat.mode` selects exactly one path, and `admitReport`'s GATE 0 refuses
-- the other's by name before any other check runs. Every observation path goes
-- through that one door, so flipping the mode cannot leave both live -- and a
-- handler added later inherits the interlock instead of having to remember it.
-- Each handler repeats the check as well, only so the refusal is logged with
-- the reason that names the path.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- BOUNDING THE AI (R6)
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- Native combat is not opt-in, so a bot inherits behaviour nobody chose: it may
-- chase a player out of the arena, or pick a fight with a vanilla NPC. Players
-- are already clamped by `client/main.lua` with `server/bounds.lua` as the
-- backstop; bots get the equivalent, in two escalating steps -- a soft `moveTo`
-- back inside, then a `setTransform` if that does not take. The soft step is
-- expected to fail in combat (`AIMoveToCommand.ignoreInCombat` is true, so the
-- behaviour tree may drop it), which is precisely why there is a hard step.
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- IDENTIFIERS
-- ===========================================================================
--
--   * PLAYER IDS ARRIVE AS STRINGS. `tonumber` at every entry point.
--   * NPC IDS ARE 64-BIT AND CROSS AS DECIMAL STRINGS. A uint64 does not
--     survive a Lua double past 2^53, so an npc id is NEVER passed through
--     `tonumber`. It is kept in the exact form the API returned it, and it is
--     looked up by its decimal-string key (`idKey`).
--   * A hot reload empties this VM's tables while the NPCs live on. Ownership
--     is always re-derived from `Open77.npcs.all()`, never from a table this VM
--     happens to hold, and orphans from a previous generation are reaped at
--     load.

--- `setTransform` arms ONE projection-adoption grant, the client's teleport is
--- asynchronous, and the 100 ms motion sample that fires in between spends the
--- grant on the corpse's position. Every subsequent report of the actual mark
--- is then a `motion_jump`: 195 of them in 30 minutes on the production PvP
--- server, 2026-09-01.
---
--- A gamemode cannot check which client binary it is talking to, and this knob

--- of being honoured into a broken state that only a packet log explains.
---
--- WHAT LIFTS THE REFUSAL. `NpcReplication` must withhold `NpcMotion` for a
--- replica whose `placementArmed` is still true, so a server-authored placement
--- is answered by the body that arrived rather than by the body that has not
--- moved yet. `respawnBot`'s PATH A is left standing and correct for that day;

--
--   1. `DeathmatchBots.attackerId(raw)` ON EVERY ATTACKER AND KILLER ID.
--      bots.lua credits ONLY bot victims. When a bot damages or kills a PLAYER,
--      the platform's own `open77:playerDamaged` / `open77:playerKilled` fire
--      with `attacker = <npcId>` -- a 64-bit number that is not a participant
--      id and that `tonumber` would corrupt. This call maps it to the bot's
--      negative participant id and passes a real player id through unchanged.
--      Without it every bot kill lands uncredited. That one call is the whole
--      "no special case" promise of the synthetic negative id.
--
--   2. `DeathmatchBots.roundLadderEligible(instanceId)` IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE
--      LADDER WRITE. Decision 12: excluded at the write, not filtered at the
--      read.
--
-- Optional, and free where they are used:
--
--   `DeathmatchBots.beginRound(instanceId, roundId)`  round.lua, at round start
--   `DeathmatchBots.reap(instanceId, reason)`         on instance close
--   `DeathmatchBots.decorateRow(row)`                 standings rows

--- INTEGRATION FIX 2026-08-31. This read `Config.map.spawns[spec.spawns]`,
--- which was true when it was written and is not any more: the ruling that
--- settled the two-maps collision moved ALL geometry into shared/kabuki.lua,

--- FIX 2026-08-31. An UNSURVEYED mark is not a coordinate, and this function used
--- to hand them out anyway. `kabuki.lua` ships every mark as an explicit
--- `{ position = nil, heading = 0.0 }` and a survey fills them in one at a time, so
--- a half-surveyed set is not an exotic state -- it is the normal one for the whole
--- of Phase 1, and the dump withholds `surveyed = true` precisely to say so.
--- `chooseSpawn` then read `candidate.position or candidate` on such a mark, fell
--- through to the mark table itself and raised
--- `attempt to perform arithmetic on a nil value (field 'x')` on every bot tick.
--- Every other consumer of the same geometry already filters -- main.lua's

--- change anywhere else.
---
--- That alias is only bound when the id survives the number round trip, which
--- is checked at creation, not assumed: a 64-bit id past 2^53 does not survive
--- a Lua double, and binding a truncated key would silently let one bot answer

-- THE THREE GATES ON CREATING AN ENGINE BODY (the 2026-09-01 crash)
--
-- A body is a `DynamicEntityService` entry on the client, and that service has
-- exactly one way to destroy one: `Despawn(cyberId)`. It has NO cancel by
-- request id. So a spawn that is still in flight -- submitted, no cyber id yet
-- -- cannot be called off, and `NpcReplication::Despawn` does the only thing it
-- can when a removal arrives in that window: it drops `replica.spawnRequest`
-- and returns. The engine then finishes the spawn, registers the entity, and
-- NOTHING EVER DESPAWNS IT. The body stands in the world running native AI with
-- no replica, no lease and no owner.
--
-- The 2026-09-01 session ended with 46 spawn submissions against 20 despawn
-- submissions and a crash reading a freed pointer, two seconds after a resource
-- hot swap. The swap is the worst case and the log shows why: the host prepares
-- the INCOMING VM before the outgoing one receives `onResourceStop`
-- (`server/main.lua` says so in as many words), so the new generation filled its
-- instance 1.1 s after the old generation's eleven despawns were submitted and
-- while five of them were still unconfirmed -- with a world transition running
-- underneath (`world epoch 2` in the same second).
--
-- These three gates make that sequence impossible from this side. They do not
-- repair the client-side gap, which is C++ and wants its own change; they
-- remove the paths that reach it.
--
--   stopping        this VM has had `onResourceStop`. It gets one more tick
--                   (`LuaResourceRuntime.Stop` calls `Tick` after emitting), and
--                   a body created in that tick is one the host is about to tear
--                   down -- the exact race.
--   settle window   after this VM starts, wait before creating anything, so the
--                   incoming generation is not spawning while the outgoing one's
--                   despawns are still in flight.
--   spacing         at most one body creation per `spawnSpacingMs` across the
--                   whole resource, so eleven simultaneous respawns become a

--- THE DEATH TRANSACTION'S OTHER HALF, AND IT REPLACES THE BODY.
---
--- BUG 2, owner 2026-09-01: *"i have a dead npc body in front of me, i'm not
--- sure if he is respawning; if i hit him over and over it says that i killed
--- him again and again."* Their scoreboard read `K 6` and some of those were
--- one corpse credited repeatedly. This is that bug, and the old code above is
--- the whole of it. Two facts, both read from the client tree:
---
--- 1. **`setTransform` cannot move an NPC body.** There is no teleport path for
---    an NPC replica anywhere in `NpcReplication.cpp`. A body is placed exactly
---    once, at `DynamicEntityService::Spawn`; after that it reaches a new
---    position only by WALKING there -- `ApplyObserverMotion` issues a native
---    `moveTo` towards the authority's reported pose, and the authority client
---    drives its own AI. `Open77.npcs.setTransform` moves the SERVER's record
---    and nothing else. A corpse walks nowhere, so the body stayed exactly
---    where it fell.
--- 2. **`revive` does not resurrect the puppet.** `ApplyState` projects the
---    server health as a stat-pool FRACTION (`NpcReplication.cpp:705-719`) and
---    never queues a `ResurrectEvent`. `Api::Life::Resurrect` exists and is
---    used for player proxies (`LifeReplication.cpp:516`) precisely because
---    `Life.hpp:105-110` records that refilling the pool alone "leaves the
---    puppet collapsed (its anim graph stays in the death/ragdoll state)".
---    It is called on no NPC anywhere.
---
--- So the old respawn produced a body that was a CORPSE on every client and
--- `alive` in this table. Every gate that protects a dead bot -- `state ~=
--- "alive"` in the hit, incoming and crossfire handlers -- passed, the player
--- shot the corpse four more times, and `declareDeath` credited another kill.
--- Every three seconds, for as long as they kept firing.
---
--- THE FIX IS TO REBUILD THE BODY. Destroy the corpse and create a fresh NPC on
--- the chosen mark. It costs one spawn per death, which is what the 3 s respawn
--- delay is for, and it is the only respawn that is true on the client as well
--- as in this table. It also unbinds the corpse's npc id, so a report still in
--- flight for the old body resolves to no bot and is refused by name
--- (`crossfire_unknown_bot` / `unknown_bot`) rather than landing on the new
--- life.
---
--- The participant id, the name, the profile and the scoreboard row all
--- survive: only the engine body and its numeric actor alias change, and the
--- alias is rebound through `rebindNpc` rather than through
--- `removeParticipant`, which would mark the row as having left.
--- Hand the ENGINE BODY back while keeping the participant.
---
--- Split out of the respawn transaction on 2026-09-01, and the split is the
--- crash fix rather than a tidy-up. The first version of the rebuild destroyed
--- the corpse and created its replacement in the SAME tick, which is a despawn
--- and a spawn issued on one frame -- precisely the concurrency the client
--- cannot cancel (see the module-state header). Releasing the body shortly after
--- death and creating the replacement at the respawn deadline puts seconds
--- between the two, and the invariant that makes it safe is simple: a dead bot
--- with `npcId == nil` has no body, and `respawnBot` refuses to run until it
--- reads that.
---
--- The corpse also stops being something the player can stand and shoot at,
--- which is the other half of what the owner reported. `corpseLingerMs` leaves
--- long enough for the death animation to play.
---
--- UNBIND BEFORE REMOVING. `Open77.npcs.remove` raises `onNpcRemoved`, whose
--- handler deletes the participant on a hit -- correct for a body the platform
--- reaped, catastrophic here.

    -- WHAT IS MISSING. A server placement here is TWO steps -- `setTransform`
    -- writes the canonical mark and arms ONE projection-adoption grant, then the
    -- client's `DrivePlacement` teleports the body asynchronously and with
    -- retries. `NpcReplication` submits `NpcMotion` from the body's live
    -- position every 100 ms throughout, so the corpse's own position reaches the
    -- server FIRST, is out of budget, takes the grant, and is adopted as
    -- canonical. The real placement then lands and is rejected as a
    -- `motion_jump` against the corpse, forever: 195 of them in 30 minutes on
    -- the production PvP server, 2026-09-01, with bodies left lying on the
    -- pavement and re-killable because `revive` had already succeeded
    -- server-side. Two placements, one grant; the grant goes to the wrong one.

    -- unadopted engine spawn projection, since fixed at the root in

    -- in-flight report for a destroyed body resolves to `not_found` and can
    -- never land on its replacement. Neither argument for MOVE survives.)

-- ARENA. Bots that hold a side.
--
-- WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE DOOR AND NOT A FLAG ON `add`. A free-for-all bot and
-- an arena bot differ in three ways at once, and every one of them has to be
-- true from the first millisecond of the body's life:
--
--   SIDE        it belongs to half a roster, and the scoreboard, the HUD roster
--               and the friendly-fire gates all key on that.
--   CLUSTER     it spawns on its side's end of the map, not on the fourteen
--               free-for-all marks -- which straddle both ends, so a bot given
--               them would open the round standing in the enemy spawn.
--   ELIMINATION it does not come back when it dies, until the round layer says
--               a new round has started.
--
-- `add` bounds the roster on `capacity - humans`, which is the free-for-all
-- rule and the wrong one here: an arena roster is EXACTLY `capacity`, the
-- humans are already counted in it by the caller, and "capacity minus one seat
-- for a human" would refuse the last bot of a 1v1. So this path does its own
-- arithmetic and calls `createBot` directly.
--
-- THE LADDER EXCLUSION NEEDS NOTHING HERE and that is deliberate: `createBot`
-- already calls `taint(instanceId)` and already reports `bot = true` to the
-- scoreboard, which sets `hadBots`. Both taints are read at the WRITE by
-- `Scoring.ladderEligible`, so an arena round with bots in it is excluded by
-- the same two mechanisms a free-for-all round is, with no arena-specific case
-- to keep in step.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

--- through, and LATER from the tick for the ones it parks. A 3v3 asks for up to
--- six bodies and `spawnSpacingMs` is 400 ms, so the tail genuinely does arrive
--- after this function has returned; a caller that read only the return value
--- would build a roster missing five of its six bots.

-- THE LEASH (R6)
--
-- Native combat is not opt-in and cannot be switched off, so a bot inherits
-- behaviour nobody chose: chase a player out of the arena, wander after a
-- vanilla NPC it decided to fight, or be pushed somewhere by a grenade. The
-- player side of this problem is already solved -- `client/main.lua` clamps at
-- 60 Hz with `server/bounds.lua` as the backstop -- and this is the equivalent
-- for a body that has no client of its own to clamp it.
--
-- THREE ANSWERS, NEVER TWO, and it is the same rule bounds.lua states for
-- players: `containsPoint` returning nil means CANNOT TELL, not "outside". An
-- unsurveyed zone, an absent bounds module or an unreadable position must
-- freeze the accumulator rather than advance it, or every bot in an unsurveyed
-- arena is dragged to a boundary that was never measured.
--
-- TWO ESCALATING STEPS, because the soft one is expected to fail. A `moveTo` on
-- a bot in combat may simply be dropped -- `AIMoveToCommand.ignoreInCombat` is
-- set true where the client builds it -- and a bot chasing somebody out of the
-- arena is by definition in combat. So the soft step is the polite attempt and
-- the hard step is the one that always works:
--
--   soft   `moveTo` to the nearest legal point. Costs nothing if ignored.
--   hard   `setTransform`. Always works, and is deliberately slow to arrive
--          because it revokes the simulation lease and bumps the authority
--          epoch, which re-elects an owner and briefly stalls native tasks.
--
-- BEYOND `teleportLimitM` neither step is right. A bot sixty metres outside did
-- not lean on the wall; it fell through the world, or followed somebody into
-- the next district. Dragging it back across that distance lands it inside
-- geometry, so it is destroyed and respawned on a surveyed mark instead --
-- which is exactly the reasoning `client/main.lua` uses for `MAX_CORRECTION_M`.

-- SEEK (bug 1, owner 2026-09-01: "the bots aren't moving [...] so they stay on
-- spawn and we never see them")
--
-- THE DEFECT, and it is two rules that are each correct alone. Native combat
-- issues no movement at all -- "an empty task queue IS the hands-off mode" --
-- and `chooseSpawn` is a MAXIMIN rule that puts every new body on the surveyed
-- mark whose nearest opponent is FARTHEST away. Put together they guarantee the
-- one arrangement in which nothing can ever happen: eight bodies, 31.7 m apart
-- at the closest and 132 m at the widest, none of which moves, inside a covered
-- market no perception radius crosses. Only a player walking into a cone, or a
-- bullet, ever started a fight.
--
-- WHY A COARSE `moveTo` RATHER THAN THE OTHER TWO CANDIDATES.
--
--   * Suppressing or replacing an observer's AI is a CLOSED DOOR. It crashed
--     every observing client and `ApplyObserverMotion` says so in the source
--     (`NpcReplication.cpp:533-542`). Nothing here touches a locomotion
--     controller.
--   * Seeding threat further out is already done, by `Api::Hostility`'s 0.5 Hz
--     sweep, and it is what made bots fight AT ALL (F22). It is not sufficient
--     for meeting: a seeded threat gives the engine a target, and the engine
--     then decides whether closing on it is worth leaving cover for. It is also
--     capped by `SeedThreat`'s cooldown and deliberately never seeds a player.
--   * Spawning them closer throws away the one fairness property the spawn rule
--     has, and would have to be undone the moment real players outnumber bots.
--
-- WHY THIS IS NOT F13 REPEATING ITSELF. F13's scripted layer re-issued `moveTo`
-- at 2 Hz and CLEARED THE MOVEMENT CHANNEL before every issue, so it cancelled
-- whatever the behaviour tree had running and a bot could never take cover,
-- strafe or break contact. Three things differ here, and each is load-bearing:
--
--   1. CADENCE. One destination per `intervalMs` (6 s), not two per second.
--   2. THE QUIET WINDOW. A bot is only ever sent somewhere when the server has
--      seen no hit report naming it, in either direction, for `combatQuietMs`.
--      `bot.lastCombatAtMs` is stamped by every report path.
--   3. THE ENGINE'S OWN VETO. `AIMoveToCommand.ignoreInCombat` is set true
--      where the client builds the command (`api/NpcTasks.cpp:425`), so a
--      `moveTo` issued a moment before contact is dropped by the engine rather
--      than obeyed by the bot. A bot that IS fighting is never steered by us,
--      and that is enforced twice -- once by our clock and once by the engine's
--      combat state, which is the authority we do not have.
--
-- The channel clear stays, because 64 tasks is the per-NPC ceiling and a
-- superseded destination must not accumulate -- but it only ever cancels OUR
-- previous seek, and it only runs on a body the quiet window already called
-- idle.

--- Something worth walking towards, and `nil` when there is none.
---
--- THREE RULES, and the second and third are the 2026-09-01 correction.
---
--- 1. **Only bots, while any bot is available.** The owner ran the first seek
---    build and reported *"they are moving now -- but they go directly toward
---    me"*: every bot took the nearest opponent, the player was in the middle of
---    the market, and eleven bots walked eleven straight lines to one person and
---    never met each other. Bot-versus-bot was ALREADY working
---    (`crossfire=39/39`, four bots killed by other bots) -- the seek was simply
---    out-competing it. Under `preferBots` a player is considered only when the
---    instance has no living bot opponent in range at all, which in a filled
---    instance is never.
---
---    The player is not thereby ignored: the engine's own senses and the
---    hostility sweep make every bot hostile to them, exactly as before. What
---    changes is that the player WALKS INTO a firefight rather than being the
---    destination of eleven of them.
---
--- 2. **Nearest that is not already crowded.** Sorting by distance and taking
---    the first candidate with fewer than `maxSuitors` bots already heading for
---    it turns one scrum into several fights spread over the map. Nearest still
---    wins outright when everything is spoken for, so this can never refuse to
---    pick.
---
--- 3. **Patrol when nothing is in range**, so a lone bot is not a statue.
---
--- Walking is not a threat seed: `Api::Hostility` still never puts a player into
--- a tracker, so spawn protection is untouched either way.

--- bot -> bot, reported by the client holding the VICTIM's simulation lease.
---
--- The owner asked for this in as many words -- "les bots doivent se tuer entre
--- eux aussi" -- and under native combat it is not something this file scripts.
--- It is a question about two records that the engine's attitude matrix answers,
--- and it can only answer yes if the roster is more than one gang. That is why
--- `config.templates` names three.
---
--- WHO REPORTS. There is no player on either end, so neither owner rule covers
--- it: every client streaming both bodies watches the same exchange. The client
--- native already discarded it unless that client holds the victim's authority
--- lease -- exactly one client per NPC per epoch, elected by the server and
--- epoch-checked on every packet -- so by the time it arrives here it is
--- unique. This handler therefore does NOT try to deduplicate; it validates
--- that both bodies are bots of the same instance and applies.
---
--- WHY THE SENDER IS NOT CHECKED against the lease here: the server-side lease
--- holder is known (`authorityPlayerId` on the NPC snapshot) and comparing it
--- would be a stronger gate -- but a lease can hand over between the hit and
--- the packet, and rejecting on that race would silently drop real bot kills
--- during exactly the moments bots are moving fastest. The bound that matters
--- is instead a cap on how much crossfire damage one bot can take per second,
--- below, which holds whether the report is unique or not.
--- EVERY REFUSAL BELOW IS LOGGED, and that is a change made for a reason.
---
--- This handler shipped with eleven silent `return`s. A session that produced
--- no bot-versus-bot damage therefore looked EXACTLY like a session in which
--- the engine never fired a shot -- the server log was empty either way, and
--- the empty log was read as "no report ever arrived" when it could equally
--- have meant "eleven reports arrived and every one was dropped here". That is
--- the failure shape this project has paid for repeatedly: a path that fails
--- closed with no trace. `crossfireCount` also tallies arrivals unconditionally,
--- so `/dm.bot list` can distinguish the two without reading a log at all.
