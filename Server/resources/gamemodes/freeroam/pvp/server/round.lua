-- Kabuki Arena -- the free-for-all round loop, one per instance.
--
-- FREE-FOR-ALL IS A PLACE, NOT A MATCH. Everything in this file follows from
-- that one sentence and nothing in it should be read as a smaller version of
-- the old `match` state machine:
--
--   * it never queues and it has no countdown gate. A joiner is placed into a
--     LIVE round, mid-fight, alive and armed;
--   * a round ends on a timer or a kill limit, shows standings for a few
--     seconds, and then the NEXT round starts with the same players still
--     standing in the same instance, with the equalizer weapon rotated;
--   * nobody is ever ejected to the lobby between rounds. The instance
--     outlives every round it runs. `instance.round` is replaced; the instance
--     is not.
--
-- The old `match` upvalue is exactly the bug this file removes: several
-- instances run at once, so every deadline and every timer lives ON THE
-- INSTANCE (`instance.round`), never at module scope. The two module-scope
-- tables left are per-PLAYER facts that no instance can own -- the refusal card
-- a joiner was last shown, and the spawn-protection deadline, which has to
-- survive the placement that crosses the lobby/instance boundary. Both are
-- keyed by player id, repopulated lazily, and cleared by `Deathmatch.forget`.
--
--
-- WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT OWN, AND THE LINE IS SHARP
--
--   * THE SCORE IS scoring.lua's. Every kill, death, assist, bonus, streak and
--     standings row lives on `instance.scoreboard` and nothing here keeps a
--     second copy. Two counters that can disagree is the same defect as two
--     containment tests: it surfaces as a scoreboard that does not match the
--     round that just ended. Of the score, this file reads exactly one number
--     -- the killer's kill count, because the KILL LIMIT is a round rule --
--     and it reads it back from scoring rather than tallying it.
--
--     The wiring follows from that: scoring.lua registers `open77:playerKilled`
--     and `open77:playerDied` ITSELF, scores the death, and then hands it to
--     the handler registered at the bottom of this file. So a counted death
--     arrives here already suppressed (placements), already debounced (one
--     death, two events) and already credited. Nothing here re-guards it, and
--     nothing here calls `Scoring.credit` -- that would be this file scoring
--     the death scoring.lua just handed it.
--
--   * THE LOADOUT IS loadout.lua's. Which slots, which records, which reserve,
--     the assign handshake and the TweakDBID verification. What this file owns
--     is WHEN: the rotation is advanced once per round, here, because "one
--     weapon per round for everyone" is a round rule.
--
--   * PLACEMENT IS main.lua's. Every move in the mode is one
--     `kill -> respawn` primitive, and there is exactly one of them.
--
-- This file publishes the small set of seams both round loops need
-- (`Deathmatch.place`, `Deathmatch.equip`, `Deathmatch.fragmentFor`,
-- `Deathmatch.leave`). They live here rather than in arena.lua because
-- round.lua loads first; arena.lua reads them at call time, so load order is
-- the only ordering constraint between the two.
--
--
-- ===========================================================================
-- ===  CHANGES server/main.lua AND open77.lua NEED.  APPLY THESE BY HAND. ===
-- ===========================================================================
--
-- Anchored search/replace rather than line numbers, in the same style as
-- instances.lua's M1-M10 and for the same reason: main.lua is being rewritten
-- in parallel and line numbers will have moved. Numbered R1-R12 so they can be
-- applied alongside M1-M10 (instances.lua) and L1-L3 / S1-S6 (loadout.lua,
-- scoring.lua) without any list renumbering another. THEY ASSUME M1-M10, L1-L3
-- AND S1-S6 ARE ALSO APPLIED.
--
-- --- R1. The manifest. ALREADY DONE -- do not reorder it. ----------------
--
-- `resources/gamemodes/open77_deathmatch/open77.lua` now lists all nine server scripts,
-- and LOAD ORDER IS MANIFEST ORDER. The shipped order is:
--
--     instances, bounds, loadout, scoring, bots, round, arena, survey, main
--
-- which satisfies everything these two files need and is not the order this
-- entry originally asked for. It is the better one, so it stays: round.lua
-- registers its death handler with `Deathmatch.scoring` AT LOAD, so scoring.lua
-- has to come first, and only the `onResourceStart` re-registration would have
-- rescued the other order. arena.lua after round.lua is the one constraint that
-- is genuinely required, because arena.lua reads the seams this file publishes.
-- Everything else between them resolves at call time.
--
-- --- R2. main.lua registers its placement primitives, once. ---------------
--
-- bounds.lua decides and main.lua places (M7); the same division holds here.
-- Nothing in round.lua or arena.lua ever calls `Open77.players.kill` or
-- `respawn`. Near the bottom of main.lua, beside the M7 block:
--
--   + Deathmatch.setPlacement(placeInArena, sendToLobby)
--
-- `placeInArena` GAINS A FIFTH PARAMETER, and it is not optional for the arena:
--
--   -  local function placeInArena(playerId, activeMatch, reason, graceMs)
--   -      local spawn, minimumSeparation = spawnFor(activeMatch, playerId)
--   +  local function placeInArena(playerId, instance, reason, graceMs, mark)
--   +      -- An explicit mark is used VERBATIM. arena.lua passes the surveyed
--   +      -- team mark for the player's side, and a maximin choice over the
--   +      -- free-for-all marks would put a duellist outside the carved 1v1
--   +      -- zone -- where the bounds backstop would then "correct" them by
--   +      -- killing them. Free-for-all passes nothing and keeps maximin.
--   +      local spawn, minimumSeparation = mark, nil
--   +      if spawn == nil then spawn, minimumSeparation = spawnFor(instance, playerId) end
--   +      if spawn == nil or DeathmatchKabuki.point(spawn.position) == nil then
--   +          return false, "not_surveyed"
--   +      end
--
-- and its body reads `instance.bucket` rather than `Config.arena.bucket` (M2)
-- and `Config.placement.spawnLiftMetres` rather than
-- `Config.arena.spawnLiftMetres`. `spawnFor` reads `DeathmatchKabuki.spawns.ffa`
-- instead of `Config.arena.spawns` and SKIPS entries whose `position` is still
-- nil: an unsurveyed mark is not a coordinate and must never be placed onto.
--
-- Both primitives return `ok` and may return a second `detail` string.
--
-- --- R3. main.lua registers NOTHING for the loadout. ----------------------
--
-- This entry used to hand main.lua's `equipWeapon` and `stripWeapons` to
-- `Deathmatch.setLoadout`. loadout.lua has landed and publishes
-- `Deathmatch.loadout.equip/strip/resupply`; the seam below prefers it, at call
-- time, over anything main.lua registers, and L1 deletes the two functions
-- outright. So `setLoadout` survives only as a fallback for a resource set
-- built without loadout.lua. DO NOT WIRE IT.
--
-- --- R4. Every placement tells the ledger not to count its death. ---------
--
-- `placeAt` moves a player with `kill -> respawn`, so without a suppression
-- window every arena entry, every respawn and every bounds backstop scores as a
-- death:
--
--   -    suppressDeathUntil[playerId] = nowMs() + 2500
--   +    Deathmatch.scoring.suppressDeath(playerId, 2500)
--
-- ONE call, not two. This entry originally asked for a second window belonging
-- to round.lua; the ruling that scoring.lua owns the score settled that -- there
-- is one suppression window and one death ledger in this mode.
-- `Deathmatch.suppressDeath` still exists and still works, but it now FORWARDS
-- into `Deathmatch.scoring.suppressDeath`, so a main.lua calling both simply
-- writes the same deadline twice. Drop the `Deathmatch.suppressDeath` line when
-- main.lua is next touched.
--
-- --- R5. Free-for-all entry calls the round, not a queue. -----------------
--
-- `joinRequest` loses the whole queue path. Decision 2: there is nothing to
-- wait for, so there is nothing to enrol in.
--
--   local function joinRequest(playerId)
--       local record = ensurePlayer(playerId)
--       if record == nil then return end
--   -    if not Open77.ready.isReady(playerId) then ... end
--   -    if queueContains(playerId) then ... end
--   -    addToQueue(playerId)
--   -    ...
--   +    Deathmatch.round.join(playerId)     -- readiness, capacity and the
--   +                                        -- refusal card are all its job
--       broadcastState()
--   end
--
-- `deathmatch:stationEnter` routes here too. The arena station is a different
-- event and a different entry point -- see R6.
--
-- --- R6. The arena queue and the buy window get their net events. ---------
--
--   + RegisterNetEvent("deathmatch:queue", function(size)
--   +     Deathmatch.arena.enqueue(source, size)
--   +     broadcastState()
--   + end)
--   + RegisterNetEvent("deathmatch:kit", function(key)
--   +     Deathmatch.arena.pickKit(source, key)
--   + end)
--
-- `deathmatch:stationQueue` opens the panel; the panel sends `deathmatch:queue`.
-- `pickKit` is a GATE, not a writer: the buy window is a round phase and only
-- the round knows whether it is open, so arena.lua checks the phase and then
-- hands the choice to `Deathmatch.loadout.chooseKit`, which validates the key
-- against the shipped list. loadout.lua also registers `deathmatch:pickKit` for
-- the same act, so this handler is optional -- keep whichever event the HUD
-- actually sends and delete the other.
--
-- --- R7. Leaving dispatches. ----------------------------------------------
--
-- `deathmatch:leave` and the `deathmatch.leave` command lose `removeParticipant`,
-- `removeFromQueue` and the whole `scope` dance:
--
--   -    removeFromQueue(playerId)
--   -    removeParticipant(playerId, "player_left", true)
--   -    notice(playerId, "warning", "MATCH QUITTE", ...)
--   +    Deathmatch.leave(playerId, scope)
--
-- It handles all three cases -- an arena queue entry, a free-for-all instance,
-- an arena match -- and answers "the player is in none of them" by doing
-- nothing. `removeParticipant`, `queuePosition`, `queueContains`, `addToQueue`,
-- `removeFromQueue` and the `queue` table all go with M10.
--
-- --- R8. Death, and disconnect. -------------------------------------------
--
-- THIS ENTRY SHRANK WHEN scoring.lua LANDED, and the shrinking is the point.
-- scoring.lua registers `open77:playerKilled` and `open77:playerDied` ITSELF,
-- scores the death, and then hands it to the handler round.lua registers at
-- load. So the round rule -- the respawn timer, the kill limit, the arena
-- elimination -- arrives by the same path that scored it, once, and there is
-- nothing in main.lua to wire.
--
-- S1 therefore DELETES both handlers from main.lua. If they are kept anyway,
-- keep them in exactly this shape:
--
--    AddEventHandler("open77:playerKilled", function(victimId, killerId)
--   -    countDeath(tonumber(victimId) or 0, tonumber(killerId) or 0, "player")
--   +    Deathmatch.onDeath(victimId, killerId, "player")
--    end)
--
-- `Deathmatch.onDeath` does NOT run the round rule directly: it forwards into
-- `Scoring.credit`, the same door bots.lua uses, so whichever of the two
-- describers arrives first counts and the second is dropped inside the
-- `countDeath` debounce. Ids are handed over RAW -- it normalises them itself,
-- because they arrive as strings and a `tonumber` at only one of two call sites
-- is how two tables silently diverge.
--
-- And in `onPlayerDisconnected`, beside the M8 lines and BEFORE
-- `Deathmatch.instances.detach`:
--
--   +    Deathmatch.forget(playerId)
--
-- The ordering is load-bearing: after a detach there is no way to tell which
-- arena side just lost a body, and the forfeit rule needs to know.
--
-- --- R9. The tick calls both loops. ---------------------------------------
--
-- Beside the M6 and L3 lines, in this order -- the kernel reaps first so a
-- round never steps an instance that is about to be closed:
--
--        local at = nowMs()
--        Deathmatch.instances.reap(at)
--        Deathmatch.bounds.tick(at)
--        Deathmatch.loadout.sweep(at)
--   +    Deathmatch.round.tick(at)
--   +    Deathmatch.arena.tick(at)
--
-- and DELETE the whole `if match ~= nil then ... else maybeFormMatch() end`
-- block above it.
--
-- --- R10. The state push merges a fragment. -------------------------------
--
-- `stateFor` keeps the record-shaped part it owns and takes everything about
-- the fight from one call. `Deathmatch.fragmentFor` dispatches on the player's
-- instance -- free-for-all, arena, or lobby -- so main.lua never learns which
-- mode a player is in:
--
--    local function stateFor(playerId)
--        local record = players[playerId]
--        local payload = {
--            playerId = playerId,
--   -        phase = match and match.state or "waiting",
--   -        playerState = record and record.state or "lobby",
--   -        queuePosition = ..., queueCount = ..., minimumPlayers = ...,
--   -        lobbyRadius = ..., participantCount = ..., participant = ...,
--   -        queuedNext = ..., canJoin = ..., canLeaveMatch = ...,
--        }
--   +    for key, value in pairs(Deathmatch.fragmentFor(playerId)) do
--   +        payload[key] = value
--   +    end
--        ...
--    end
--
-- THE FRAGMENT IS AUTHORITATIVE FOR `phase` AND `playerState`. Do not fall back
-- to `record.state` behind it: a player eliminated in an arena round and a
-- player waiting out a free-for-all respawn are different states main.lua has
-- no way to tell apart, and `record.state` is the stale copy. `phase` for a
-- player in no instance is `"lobby"` -- never `"waiting"`, which is the word a
-- client reads as "draw a waiting room".
--
-- The `match.state == "countdown"` / `"active"` / `"resolved"` branch below it
-- goes with the fragment, and so does `Config.match.statePushMs` ->
-- `Config.round.statePushMs`.
--
-- --- R11. Standings come from the one scoreboard. -------------------------
--
-- Nothing to do beyond S1, which already replaces `sortedRows`:
--
--   -    rows = sortedRows(match),
--   +    rows = Deathmatch.scoring.rows(Deathmatch.instances.of(playerId))
--
-- This entry originally asked for `sortedRows(instance)` reading an
-- `instance.stats` table these two files maintained. That table is gone: there
-- is ONE scoreboard, on `instance.scoreboard`, and scoring.lua owns it. What
-- the round keeps of the score is the kill count the kill LIMIT is measured on,
-- and it reads that back from scoring rather than tallying it in parallel.
--
-- --- R12. Ready and re-ready adopt rather than evict. ---------------------
--
-- `deathmatch:ready` re-primes a participant by pushing them into
-- `Config.arena.bucket`. With M4 in place `ensurePlayer` has already adopted
-- them, so the branch collapses:
--
--   -    if isParticipant(playerId) then
--   -        local position = Open77.players.position(playerId)
--   -        if position ~= nil and position.bucket ~= Config.arena.bucket then
--   -            SetPlayerRoutingBucket(playerId, Config.arena.bucket)
--   -        end
--   -        pushState(playerId)
--   -        return
--   -    end
--   +    if Deathmatch.instances.of(playerId) ~= nil then
--   +        pushState(playerId)
--   +        return
--   +    end
--
-- --- R13. Spawn protection breaks on aggression. --------------------------
--
-- Nothing to wire, and that is the better answer. S6 offers
-- `Deathmatch.scoring.setAggressionHandler`, and this file registers
-- `Deathmatch.breakProtection` with it at load, so a player's own CREDITED
-- outgoing damage drops their shield. Credited is the honest moment: an
-- unverified or cross-instance report is noise, not aggression, and dropping a
-- shield on it would make the shield unreliable in exactly the situation it
-- exists for.
--
-- A main.lua that registers the same handler itself is harmless --
-- `breakProtection` is idempotent and both registrations call it -- but it is
-- one more place to keep in step, so prefer letting this file own it.
--
-- --- R14. What main.lua may now delete. -----------------------------------
--
-- Beyond M10's, L1's and S1's lists, and all of it because this file or
-- arena.lua owns it:
--
--   `nextMatchId`, `allocateMatchId`, `capturedRules`, `chooseWinner`,
--   `resolveMatch`, `finishResolution`, `removeParticipant`, `scheduleRespawn`,
--   `participantCount`, `isParticipant`, the `Config.match.resultSeconds`
--   reads, and the `deathmatch.status` command's `minimumPlayers()` / `#queue`
--   / `match.weapon` readout -- `Deathmatch.instances.describe()`,
--   `/dm.rounds` and `/dm.arena` say the same thing about every instance
--   instead of about the one global there used to be.
--
-- `Open77.tunables.promote()` goes too, and this is the subtle one: it is
-- per-RESOURCE, so promoting when instance B starts a round would move
-- instance A's finish line. The kernel captures the whole set onto each
-- instance at open and every rule here reads `instance.tune`.

-- Two calls main.lua makes that predate scoring.lua landing. Both are kept, and
-- both are now FORWARDERS into the one scoreboard rather than a second answer:
-- there is one suppression window and one death ledger in this mode, and these
-- reach them rather than shadowing them.
--
-- Both are safe to delete from main.lua when it is next touched. `suppressDeath`
-- is already paired there with the `Deathmatch.scoring.suppressDeath` of S2, so
-- it writes the same deadline twice; `onDeath` is paired with scoring.lua's own
-- registration of the same two engine events, and the debounce inside
-- `countDeath` is what makes the pair harmless rather than double-counted.

--- Every placement is a `kill -> respawn`, so main.lua calls this before every
--- one. scoring.lua owns the window; this is the older spelling of the same act.

--- handlers. It does NOT run the round rule directly: it goes through
--- `Scoring.credit`, which is the same door bots.lua uses, so whichever of the

--- debounce. The round consequences then arrive back here through the death
--- handler registered below, once, by the only path that scores.
