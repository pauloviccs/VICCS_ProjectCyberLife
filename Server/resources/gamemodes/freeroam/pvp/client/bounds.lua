-- Client half of the Open77 PvP gamemode.
--
-- Two jobs: announce readiness so the server can place this player, and RUN
-- THE WALL.
--
-- The wall being here is not a design preference, it is a measurement. Phase 0
-- E2 asked whether a prop can be solid and invisible at the same time, because
-- an invisible wall built from props would have been per-instance, free and
-- entirely server-side. The answer was no: `visible = false` is accepted by the
-- API, reports `created=8 refused=0`, and renders the prop anyway. Props are
-- solid (E1, measured against a control) but they cannot be hidden, so they can
-- MARK a boundary and never BE one.
--
-- That leaves the standard shape for this problem, and the one the platform is
-- built for: the client clamps its own position, and the server keeps a
-- backstop for the case where the clamp is absent, disabled or lying. See
-- server/bounds.lua -- a clamp that can be switched off is not authority.
--
-- Why a transform write is legitimate here, when every other move in this
-- resource is a kill -> respawn: the respawn transaction exists to carry the
-- fade, the streaming preload and the grace window across a real distance. A
-- correction of a few centimetres needs none of those, and using a respawn for
-- it would be a black screen every time somebody leaned on the boundary. This
-- is the one place in the mode where `Open77.travel.teleport` is the right
-- primitive, and it is bounded below so it can never become a teleport.

-- --------------------------------------------- forwarding an ENGINE hit ---
--
-- WHAT WAS HERE BEFORE, and why it is gone. This used to poll
-- `Open77.weapons.snapshot()` at 10 Hz, notice the magazine counter fall, and
-- send the camera ray as a guess at where the bullet went. Every part of that
-- was a workaround for not being able to see the shot: the ray was sampled when
-- the DROP was noticed rather than when the trigger was pulled, so a fast turn
-- while firing skewed it; a burst that emptied between two polls arrived as
-- several rays along one bearing; and the server then had to guess a victim by
-- casting that ray against capsules it invented, with no walls and no bones.
--
-- None of that is necessary. The engine already computes the hit -- properly,
-- with the real skeleton, the real cover and the real weapon stats -- and
-- `client/src/network/CombatReplication.cpp` now watches for it: the wrapped
-- `ScriptedPuppet.OnHit` reports through a bridge native and the drain emits
-- these two events. So this file no longer detects anything. It forwards.
--
-- THE TWO DIRECTIONS ARE REPORTED BY DIFFERENT CLIENTS, and that is the rule
-- that makes bots work in multiplayer at all. Every client that streams a bot
-- in runs its own copy of that bot's combat AI -- nothing in Open77 can
-- suppress it -- so on my screen it is shooting me and on yours it is shooting
-- you. If a witness were allowed to report, one burst would be credited once
-- per spectator.
--
--   open77:npcHit         I shot a bot. Only my client's player pulled that
--                         trigger, so I am the only possible reporter.
--   open77:npcAttackedMe  a bot shot me. Only my client owns my body, so again
--                         I am the only possible reporter.
--
-- Neither number is trusted. The server takes the player -> bot amount from its
-- own round-weapon table so a bot dies in the same number of shots a player
-- does; it takes the bot -> player amount from the engine but clamps it,
-- because a gang record's rifle is priced for a levelled solo player.
--
-- The intercept Z travels ABSOLUTE and unaltered. The server differences it
-- against the canonical bot transform to decide head or torso -- a body part
-- this side computed would be a damage multiplier this side chose.
