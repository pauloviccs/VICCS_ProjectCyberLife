-- Kabuki Arena map data -- the surveyed geometry of the one PvP map.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- THIS FILE IS NOW THE BUILT-IN DEFAULT OF A RUNTIME MAP STORE.
--
-- `server/mapstore.lua` snapshots the tables below at load, before anything
-- can write to them, and registers the snapshot as the map named `kabuki`.
-- From then on the geometry the mode reads is whichever map the `activeMap`
-- tunable selects, applied INTO these same tables -- which is why every
-- consumer in the resource is unchanged and why there is still exactly one
-- containment test.
--
-- Three consequences worth knowing before editing this file:
--
--   1. The built-in is never destroyed and never written to. An empty store
--      plays it, `/dm.map select kabuki` restores it, and `/dm.map export`
--      prints a runtime map in exactly the block shapes below so a finished
--      map can be PASTED HERE and become a built-in under source control.
--      That paste is the one remaining reason to edit this file by hand -- and
--      it hot-swaps the resource set, so it is done deliberately and never
--      mid-session.
--
--   2. `Kabuki.volumes`, `.spawns`, `.teams` and `.stations` are REPLACED
--      wholesale at runtime. Nothing may hold a reference to one of them
--      across a call; read through `DeathmatchKabuki` at the point of use, the
--      way `spawnFor`, `arena.lua` and `bounds.lua` already do.
--
--   3. `Kabuki.surveyed` is RECOMPUTED on every apply, from the volumes the
--      active map's zones actually name. The paragraph below still governs
--      what it means; it is simply measured now instead of asserted.
--
-- Plan §12 decision 5 ("one map, four zones") is intact and was re-decided
-- explicitly rather than drifted: the mode still plays ONE map at a time. See
-- decision 21 in docs/gamemode-pvp-arena-plan.md.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- THE COORDINATES IN THIS FILE DO NOT EXIST YET. Every position is an explicit
-- `nil` and every heading an explicit `0.0`: this file is the *shape* the data
-- takes, and Phase 1 fills it in-game with `/dm.survey` (server/survey.lua),
-- which dumps assignment statements that replace the placeholder blocks below.
-- See docs/gamemode-pvp-arena-plan.md section 3 and Phase 1.
--
-- Why placeholders rather than an empty table: the counts are decisions, not
-- accidents. Seven volumes, fourteen FFA marks, three marks a side for 3v3, two
-- lobby stations. A surveyor who sees fourteen empty slots knows the job is not
-- done at eight; an empty table tells them nothing.
--
-- Why boxes and not a cylinder or a polygon prism (decision 6): Kabuki is a
-- gallery six metres above a sunken floor, so a cylinder either clips the
-- bridge off or swallows the street outside. A box containment test is six
-- comparisons and is trivially correct; a polygon needs an ordered ring and a
-- winding test and buys nothing at this scale. A point is inside the arena if
-- it is inside ANY volume of the format's zone.
--
-- Shared rather than server-only on purpose: the wall is a client-side clamp
-- (decision 15, settled by E2) and the clamp needs exactly this geometry.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- UNRESOLVED: THERE ARE TWO MAPS IN THIS RESOURCE.
--
-- `shared/config.lua` grew a `DeathmatchConfig.map` block carrying the same
-- seven volume ids, the same zone lists and provisional North Watson spawn
-- marks, plus `DeathmatchConfig.zones`. That is the same geometry in a second
-- place, and two containment tests that can disagree are a bug waiting to
-- happen. One of the two must win before Phase 2 builds on either.
--
-- Nothing here reaches into that block: this file declares a shape and owns the
-- geometry FUNCTIONS, and every one of them takes its volume list as an
-- argument (`locateIn`, `nearestIn`, `contains`, `distanceTo`), so whichever
-- store wins, the test that judges it is this one. `/dm.where` currently
-- reports BOTH sources side by side, labelled, which is the honest state of
-- affairs until the duplication is settled.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

DeathmatchKabuki = {}
local Kabuki = DeathmatchKabuki

-- Flipped to true in the block the surveyor pastes. Everything that reads this
-- file must degrade honestly while it is false rather than silently treating an
-- unsurveyed map as an empty one: an empty zone contains nothing, and a bounds
-- check that contains nothing places every player on every tick.
-- TRUE as of 2026-09-01, and the honesty this flag demands is preserved by
-- narrowing the formats rather than by pretending the map is fully walked.
-- Every format now lists only `market`, which HAS a box, so no zone in use is
-- unsurveyed and containment is real everywhere it is claimed. The comment
-- above still governs: a nil volume must suspend containment, and none is in
-- use. `lower`, `gallery` and the four stairs remain uncaptured and unused.
Kabuki.surveyed = true

-- --------------------------------------------------------------- volumes --

-- Order is reporting priority, not geometry: a point inside an overlap is
-- reported as the FIRST match, so the two floors and the ring come before the
-- stairs that join them -- a stair necessarily overlaps the decks at its ends,
-- and "you are on the market floor" is the more useful of the two answers.
--
-- `min` / `max` are opposite corners of an axis-aligned box in world space,
-- componentwise. `/dm.survey box <id>` captures two ground samples and derives
-- the vertical extent from them; see `boxFromCorners` for why the two samples
-- on their own cannot produce a usable box.

-- Two clusters, A and B on opposite approaches -- but one pair per format
-- rather than one pair overall. Section 3 gives each arena format a different
-- carved zone: 3v3 plays the whole footprint, 2v2 loses the gallery, and 1v1 is
-- the sunken room alone. A 1v1 taking the first mark of the 3v3 alley cluster
-- would spawn both duellists outside their own zone, and the bounds check would
-- then "correct" that by killing them. So each format captures its own pair of
-- clusters; the cost is six extra marks and it buys a rule with no exceptions.
-- Derived 2026-09-01 from the fourteen WALKED ffa marks rather than captured
-- separately, which is sound for the reason this file already gives: every
-- coordinate below is ground somebody stood on, so the Corpo Plaza failure
-- (nearby XY does not imply walkable) cannot apply. Sides are picked for
-- maximum separation -- 3v3 north vs south at 115 m, 2v2 at 117 m, 1v1 at
-- 98 m -- and each mark faces the OPPOSING cluster's centroid, so a round
-- opens looking at the fight instead of away from it.
--
-- These are honest and playable, not designed. Re-capture with
-- `/dm.survey start 3v3` once somebody has an opinion about arena geometry;
-- the point of landing them is that all three formats refuse to START while
-- a single mark is nil, so nothing about the arena could be tested at all.

-- The two lobby stations of section 5. They are marks like any other -- a
-- position and a facing -- and they are surveyed in the same pass, because the
-- surveyor is already standing in the lobby when the session opens.
--
-- One survey constraint belongs with the numbers rather than with the renderer:
-- open77_worldui activates at `radius + 0.5 m`, and two stations placed closer
-- than the sum of their activations leave a dead band in which NEITHER prompt
-- is live.
--
-- THE MINIMUM IS 6.0 m, NOT 4.6 m. This comment said 4.6 -- the sum of the two
-- ring radii plus their activation pads -- while `Config.stations.minSeparationMetres`
-- has enforced 6.0 all along, and both `server/bounds.lua` and
-- `client/station.lua` read the config value. A pair captured at 5.98 m
-- therefore looked correct against this comment and was rejected by the code,
-- and the round it cost is the reason the number is no longer written twice:
-- `/dm.map check` and `/dm.map station` both PRINT the enforced value rather
-- than quoting one. Never restate a number a rule owns.
-- Surveyed 2026-09-01 in the lobby, both from grounded server samples:
-- `enter` via `/dm.survey mark`, `queue` from a `dm.goto` that reported
-- `grounded=yes` at rest. Separation 5.98 m, clear of the 4.6 m dead band the
-- comment above forbids.
--
-- These are HONEST but not considered: they sit where the lobby spawn happens
-- to put you, not where a designer would place a pair of rings. Re-capture them
-- with `/dm.survey start station` once someone has an opinion about the lobby
-- layout -- the point of landing them now is that the station cannot be drawn,
-- and therefore cannot be tested at all, while they are nil.
